Using depth cameras to manage stray animals on campus

A four-wheel mobile robot was built, using STM-32 as the core controller and equipped with Raspberry Pi for information processing. It receives information from the radar and transmits data to the STM-32 controller. At the same time, a 3D camera collects the characteristics of small animals to establish a small animal file, and can also perceive environmental information to achieve navigation, obstacle avoidance, and tracking.
